## The Tavant Database Patch catalog
##
## This file contains a sequential list of all the database patches along with logical database name.	
## (both sql scripts and java programs) that must be run to properly
## construct and maintain a database in conjunction with the version
## of code represented by the current version of this file. Patch names
## shall be relative to tavant/dbPatches
##
## Entries in this will look like this (but will be left-justfied):
##    main/Patchyyyymmdd.[sql|java] tavant
## or
##    iri/Patchyyyymmdd.[sql|java] dba
##
##All entries in patchCatalog.txt would consist of both the patch name
##followed by a 'logical' database/schema name (seperated by whitespace). This
##would name no longer be optional.
##Failure to provide a 'logical' db name for all patches is considered to be
##an error.
##Failure to define all 'logical' names in the external properties file is an
##error.
##  Ex)
##
## Here are some guidelines on how to create db patches. 
## Please follow this strictly to avoid unnecessary issues when applying db patches via version manager.
## 1. The .sql extension should be in lower case (never use .SQL)
## 2. There should not be a ; (semicolon) after a sql statement.
## 3. There should be / (forward slash) in the next line after every sql statement.
## 4. There should not be any space or tab before or after the / (forward slash).
## 
## There is a sample patch file PATCH_TEST_VM.sql in versionmanager folder.
## Also make sure none of these patches are applied manually on any database except DEV.
